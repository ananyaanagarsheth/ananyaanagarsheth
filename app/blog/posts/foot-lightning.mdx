## The Project
During my time at the Engineering Open House (EOH) at Grainger College of Engineering (January 2023 - March 2023), I collaborated with a team to design, construct, and optimize a circuit that harnessed compressive force on piezoelectric disks. The energy generated was used to light up a lightning bolt LED, demonstrating the practical application of piezoelectric materials in electricity generation. We developed an interactive exhibit to engage visitors and showcase our work.


## The Engineering Principles
Our project was grounded in the principles of piezoelectricity, where certain materials generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. By leveraging the compressive force on piezoelectric disks, we were able to generate alternating current (AC). This AC was then utilized to power a lightning bolt LED, providing a tangible example of how mechanical energy can be converted into electrical energy. The project required careful circuit design, optimization, and a deep understanding of the behavior of piezoelectric materials under stress.

## Accolades
Our project was well-received at the Engineering Open House, where we earned Third Place in the Most Outstanding Freshman Exhibits category. This recognition highlighted the creativity, technical skill, and teamwork that went into developing and presenting our piezoelectric circuit exhibit.
