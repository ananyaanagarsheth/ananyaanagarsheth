Republic-Summer Intersnhip 2024

This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work as an engineering intern at Republic under the guidance of Robby and Ruby. Throughout my internship, I immersed myself in learning the business, the product, and the code, which included gaining proficiency in the software and languages used by the Republic web application, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, and GitHub. I also worked with data on Looker, contributing to the analysis and visualization efforts. One of the most rewarding experiences was collaborating with the U.S. marketplace team and the engineers, where I contributed to hotfixes that involved making changes to Republic's main webpage. These tasks were instrumental in helping me acclimate to the codebase in the Republic client. Overall, I had a fantastic time, learning a lot and building strong connections with the team.
